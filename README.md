# IMCTRZ-text-file-generator
A windows forms app to help with a really obscure problem that my mom had for her accounting job.

It's designed to work with a specific kind of excel document that accountants receive from some government agency or more realistically you could input the same data by hand. The UI is designed to resemble the пп30 and пп50 letters of credit common in Macedonia (see image here: http://arenal.com.mk/images/Products/virmani%20kom.jpg)

You can test how it works by running the project in Visual Studio.

Running the executable requires extra work and includes a workaround found here: https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sharepoint/en-US/4d6c383a-94eb-4898-9d22-aa4bb69be25b/excel-interop-systemruntimeinteropservicescomexception-0x800a03ec-microsoft-office-excel?forum=vbgeneral
